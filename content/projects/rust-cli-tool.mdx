# Why Rust?

I previously wrote this script in Python, but it was slow when processing directories with 10,000+ files. Rust's zero-cost abstractions made this version run almost instantly.

# Usage

```bash
cargo install rusty-clean
rusty-clean --path ./Downloads --dry-run
```

## Challenges
The hardest part was handling Concurrency. I used Rayon to parallelize the file moving operations, which cut the execution time by 40% on multi-core machines.

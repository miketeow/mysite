# Architecture

This project is designed as a modular monolith that can be split into microservices.

## Key Features
* **Auth:** JWT-based authentication with Refresh Tokens.
* **Caching:** Redis is used to cache product details, reducing DB load by 80%.
* **Rate Limiting:** Custom middleware to prevent abuse.

# Deployment

The entire stack is containerized using Docker Compose for easy local development.

```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
```

### 🔍 How to Test
1.  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/projects`.
2.  (Note: You might see a 404 if you haven't built the `app/projects/page.tsx` list page yet, but the files are now ready to be read!)

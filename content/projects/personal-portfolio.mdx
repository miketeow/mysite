# The Goal

I wanted a place to document my learning journey that didn't feel like a generic template. It needed to be:
1.  **Fast:** 100/100 Lighthouse score.
2.  **Maintainable:** Content lives in Markdown files, not a database.
3.  **Type-Safe:** Fully typed with TypeScript.

# Architecture

I decided to split the content into two collections: `blog` and `projects`.

## The Content Engine

Instead of using `contentlayer` (which is now unmaintained), I built a lightweight wrapper around the native Node.js filesystem API.

```ts
// lib/mdx.ts
export function getProjects() {
  // Reads files from content/projects directory
}
```
This allows me to have complete control over how my data is parsed and sorted.

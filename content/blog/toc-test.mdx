# Introduction

This post is generated to test the **On This Page** component. We need enough vertical height to ensure the sticky sidebar works, and enough headers to test the intersection observer.

## The Shift to Server Components

The web development landscape has shifted dramatically in the last few years. We have moved from Multi-Page Apps (MPAs) to Single Page Apps (SPAs), and now we are settling somewhere in the middle with Server Components.

This paragraph is intentionally long to force you to scroll. When you are reading this section, the "The Shift to Server Components" link in the sidebar should be highlighted with the primary color, and the colored marker line should be positioned right next to it. As you keep scrolling, it should stay active until the next header hits the top of the viewport.

## State Management Patterns

State management is arguably the hardest part of frontend development. Let's look at how we handle data today compared to 2018.

### Client-Side State
Tools like **Zustand**, **Redux**, and **Context API** are still vital. However, we are moving away from putting *everything* in a global store.

If you are seeing this H3 header in your TOC, it should be indented slightly more than the H2s. This visual hierarchy helps users understand that "Client-Side State" is a child of "State Management Patterns".

### Server-Side State
Libraries like **TanStack Query** (React Query) changed the game. We stopped treating server data as "global state" and started treating it as a "cache".

> "Server state is different from client state. It is asynchronous, you don't own it, and it can go stale."

## Performance Optimization

Performance is not just about code splitting anymore. It is about how we load assets, how we render HTML, and how we hydrate the page.

### Core Web Vitals
Google's Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) have become the standard for measuring user experience.
1.  **LCP:** Loading performance.
2.  **CLS:** Visual stability.
3.  **INP:** Interactivity.

### Code Splitting vs Bundling
A short section to test quick scrolling.

## The Future of Rendering

We are seeing a convergence of static and dynamic rendering. Partial Prerendering (PPR) is the next big thing.

This section is here to provide more scroll depth. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

## Conclusion

If the TOC worked correctly, the marker should have slid smoothly from top to bottom as you read through this article.

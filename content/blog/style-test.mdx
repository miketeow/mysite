# Introduction

This is a post created for the sole purpose of **testing our new markdown styling**. We will go through various common elements to ensure everything looks as expected.

Let's start with some basic text formatting. This is a standard paragraph. We can have *italic text* for emphasis, or **bold text** for stronger emphasis. Sometimes you might even need ~~strikethrough text~~.

## Headings

We should also test our heading hierarchy.

### H3 Heading
This is a subsection. It should be smaller than an H2.

#### H4 Heading
This is an even smaller section, useful for deep nesting.

---

## Links

Here we test the different behaviors of our custom link component.

### Internal Links
This is a link to another page within our own website, like an [About Page](/about) or another blog post. It should navigate via client-side routing without a full page reload.

### Anchor Links
This is a link to a specific section on this very page. Let's jump down to the [Conclusion](#conclusion) at the bottom. It should scroll smoothly to that section.

### External Links
This is a link to an external website, like [Google](https://google.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com). It should automatically open in a **new tab** and have `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security.

## Blockquotes and Lists

Sometimes we want to quote someone or highlight a specific block of text.

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
>
> — Steve Jobs

We can even have nested blockquotes:

> This is the outer quote.
>
> > And this is a nested quote inside it. This helps test our border and padding styles for deeper levels.

### Lists

Here is an unordered list:
* Item one
* Item two
    * Nested item A
    * Nested item B
* Item three

And an ordered list:
1.  First step
2.  Second step
3.  Final step

## Code Blocks

This is the most important part. We need to verify that our syntax highlighting works correctly across different programming languages, and that our copy button is functional.

### JavaScript

A simple JavaScript snippet demonstrating DOM manipulation and an event listener.

```javascript
// Select an element
const button = document.querySelector('#my-button');

/**
 * Handles the click event.
 * @param {Event} event - The click event.
 */
function handleClick(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log('Button clicked!', event.target);

  const message = "Hello, world!";
  alert(message);
}

// Add the listener
if (button) {
  button.addEventListener('click', handleClick);
}
```

### TypeScript
Here we test TypeScript-specific syntax like interfaces, type annotations, and generics.


```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  username: string;
  isAdmin?: boolean; // Optional property
}

function getUser<T extends User>(users: T[], id: number): T | undefined {
  return users.find(user => user.id === id);
}

const users: User[] = [
  { id: 1, username: 'alice', isAdmin: true },
  { id: 2, username: 'bob' },
];

const user = getUser(users, 1);

if (user) {
  console.log(`Found user: ${user.username.toUpperCase()}`);
}
```

### Rust

Rust has a unique syntax with macros, lifetimes, and specific keywords.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    // A static method (associated function)
    fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }

    // A method that borrows self
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f64 {
        let sum_squares = (self.x.pow(2) + self.y.pow(2)) as f64;
        sum_squares.sqrt()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point::new(3, 4);
    println!("Created point: {:?}", p);
    println!("Distance from origin: {:.2}", p.distance_from_origin());

    let message = String::from("Hello from Rust!");
    // Test a closure
    let print_message = || println!("{}", message);
    print_message();
}
```

### C

Finally, a classic C example to test low-level language highlighting, including preprocessor directives, pointers, and standard library functions.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// A simple struct
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

// Function that takes a pointer to a struct
void print_point(Point *p) {
    if (p == NULL) {
        return;
    }
    printf("Point at (%d, %d)\n", p->x, p->y);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Hello, World! Program name: %s\n", argv[0]);

    // Allocate memory for a point
    Point *p1 = (Point *)malloc(sizeof(Point));
    if (p1 == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    p1->x = 10;
    p1->y = 20;

    print_point(p1);

    // Free the allocated memory
    free(p1);
    p1 = NULL;

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion
This concludes our style test post. If you clicked the anchor link above, you should have landed right here. We have covered typography, different types of links, blockquotes, lists, and code blocks in four different languages.

Check the rendered page to ensure all styles are applied correctly!
